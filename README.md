# AdaptableBlotter.JS Performance Monitor

Use this repository to test the performance of AdaptableBlotter.JS (running on top of OpenFin's Hypergrid and using dummy data).

You can stipulate the number of columns and the number of rows, and set the 'ticking rate' of the Blotter.

You can additionally see how many Conditional Styles are running at any one time (and of course add your own) and also monitor the framerate of the Blotter.

Adaptable Blotter licences are free for development use, but a paid-for annual end user licence is required for each production user. 

Further information about AdaptableBlotter.JS, and full Help, is available atÂ www.adaptabletools.com.
